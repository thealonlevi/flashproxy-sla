# flashproxy-status

Open-source, fully reproducible **SLA monitoring for proxy services**. It actively
simulates the payload archetypes of real proxy users, runs each workload **both
through the proxy and directly (no-proxy baseline)**, and measures latency,
throughput, and availability — so degradation is caught before customers complain,
and the proxy's overhead over the raw network is explicit.

**Live:** <https://status.flashproxy.com> · **SLA:** <https://status.flashproxy.com/sla>
· built by **[FlashProxy](https://flashproxy.com)**.

It is a **closed, fully reproducible system**: every number on the public page was
recorded by this app itself, into its *own* ClickHouse. Nothing is read from any
internal or production data source — and that metrics database is **publicly
readable**, so anyone can independently reproduce every figure (this is what makes
the FlashProxy SLA verifiable). Clone it, point it at any proxy, and you get the
same dashboard.

```
 origin ──▶ [proxy under test] ──▶ worker ──▶ own ClickHouse ──▶ website ──▶ status page + /sla
            (+ direct baseline)   (probes,     (system of        (read-only,   (SSR, crawlable,
                                   writer role)  record)           sla_reader)   independently
                                                                                 verifiable)
```

The only thing crossing into the system from the outside is the **proxy endpoint +
credentials** you put in config — an input, not a data source. Read and write are
split by ClickHouse role, so you can run **N workers** (e.g. one VM per region) all
writing to one ClickHouse, with read-only websites on top.

## Live deployment

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status page** | <https://status.flashproxy.com> |
| **SLA** | <https://status.flashproxy.com/sla> — 100% uptime guarantee, automatically compensated, independently verifiable |
| **Public metrics DB** (read-only) | `https://ch.flashproxy.com` · user `flashproxy-status-public` · password `flashproxy-public-ro` · database `sla` |
| **Company** | <https://flashproxy.com> |

The production deployment runs workers in **AWS Ashburn (us-east-1)** and **Frankfurt
(eu-central-1)**, writing to a self-hosted ClickHouse on a bare-metal host exposed only
through a Cloudflare tunnel (`ch.flashproxy.com`).

## What it measures

Per product, per vantage, every workload runs **twice** — through the proxy and
**direct** (no-proxy baseline, suffixed `_direct`) — so the proxy's overhead is
visible. One row per attempt lands in `sla.probe_raw`.

| Scenario | Simulates | Headline metric |
|---|---|---|
| `connect` | upstream connect + round-trip to origin | **round-trip response time (ttfb)** — the SLA latency metric |
| `net_rtt` | raw gateway network RTT (TCP connect) | network RTT ms |
| `streaming` | heavy streaming / buffering | sustained throughput (Mbps, measured over the transfer window) |
| `large_object` | large-object download | TTFB / throughput |
| `hifreq_small` | account / credential checkers | connect-ms distribution + setup success |
| `scraping` | broad web scraping (many hosts) | connect-ms spread |
| `long_session` | long-maintained / persistent sessions | hold stability |

The headline `connect` probe targets the project's **own deterministic origin**, not a
third-party site, so the SLA number isn't polluted by some external host's availability
(third-party reachability is measured separately by `scraping`). The page auto-selects
the **best vantage** per product (lowest average response time) as the default, with a
per-product toggle; the latency chart overlays **response time via proxy vs direct** so the
network floor and the proxy overhead are side by side. `net_rtt` is a stdlib TCP-connect
timing (no ICMP/raw sockets), so it works unprivileged in the distroless image.

## The SLA verdict (how status & uptime are computed)

`internal/slo` implements the published SLA contract exactly, so the page and the
contract can't drift:

- **Available** — the `connect` scenario succeeds.
- **Down** — a minute that is below the success threshold (`down_success_pct`, default 90) **from every vantage simultaneously**. A single-vantage failure is **not** Down (it isolates one network path, not the proxy).
- **Degraded** — Available, but the **best vantage's average round-trip response time exceeds 50 ms for 5 consecutive minutes** (and stays Degraded until it recovers). The run-up minutes before the trigger are not yet Degraded.
- **Availability%** = (minutes with data − Down − ½·Degraded) / minutes with data × 100.

The exact thresholds are published at `/api/meta`, so the verdict is reproducible from
data — not just from the source.

## Architecture

| Component | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cmd/origin` | Deterministic dual-stack upstream (`/connect`, `/bytes/{n}`, `/small`, `/hold`). Pure SLA signal, no third-party variance. |
| `cmd/worker` | Runs every scenario from one vantage (via proxy + direct), writes results **directly** to ClickHouse as the `sla_writer` role, and appends an integrity-ledger entry per batch. The only component that touches a real proxy. **Exactly one worker per vantage** (the vantage is the ledger stream key). Set `"monitor": true` on one to evaluate SLO, fire Discord alerts, and sign ledger checkpoints. Drains on shutdown and retains batches on transient errors, so deploys/outages don't drop SLA data. |
| `cmd/website` | **Read-only.** Server-renders the status page and `/sla`, serves the JSON API, and publishes the public read-only key + SLO thresholds + ledger public key at `/api/meta` — all as the `sla_reader` role; never writes. Hardened HTTP server (timeouts, recovery, security headers) with a real ClickHouse readiness check. |
| `cmd/verify` | **Standalone public verifier.** Recomputes every batch/entry hash and checks every Ed25519 checkpoint signature using only public read access — the tool anyone runs to confirm the data is untampered. |
| `cmd/keygen` | Generates the Ed25519 checkpoint-signing keypair. |
| `internal/{probe,slo,chstore,model,ledger}` | Scenario probes, the SLA-contract SLO evaluation, a stdlib-only ClickHouse HTTP client, shared types + their frozen canonical serialization, and the hash-chain/signing primitives. |
| `web/` | Framework-free, console-style, server-rendered status + SLA pages. |

## Integrity: tamper-evident measurements

Because FlashProxy controls the database, the metrics alone can't prove they weren't
edited after the fact. So every batch of measurements is committed to an **append-only,
hash-chained ledger** (`sla.ledger`), and the chain heads are periodically
**Ed25519-signed** into `sla.ledger_checkpoints`. Any retroactive edit, deletion, or
reorder of a measurement breaks the recomputed hashes against the signed checkpoints.

Verify it yourself against the public database — nothing but the published key needed:

```bash
go run ./cmd/verify -ch https://ch.flashproxy.com \
  -user flashproxy-status-public -pass flashproxy-public-ro \
  -pubkey "$(curl -s https://status.flashproxy.com/api/meta | jq -r .integrity.pubkey)"
```

It walks every per-vantage chain, recomputes each batch hash from the raw rows, and
checks every checkpoint signature, reporting any break, gap, or bad signature. This is
**tamper-evidence**, not a claim that the measurements are honest at generation time —
that rests on the open-source code, multiple independent vantages, and live publication.
(Checkpoints are signed and stored in the public DB; an external anchor — OpenTimestamps
/ a transparency log — can be added with no schema change to also defeat key-holder
rewrites.)

Dependency-free Go (standard library only) — builds offline, trivially reproducible.
ClickHouse is accessed over its HTTP interface; the AWS instances build the binaries
from source on first boot (no container registry required).

## ClickHouse roles

`schema/clickhouse.sql` creates the tables; `schema/roles.sql` creates two roles and
three users (concurrency-capped via `max_concurrent_queries_for_user`):

| User | Role | Cap | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `flashproxy-status-public` | `sla_reader` | 50 | **published** — anyone can query the raw data, verify the ledger, and reproduce the page |
| `flashproxy-status-website` | `sla_reader` | 50 | the website renders with this |
| `flashproxy-status-worker` | `sla_writer` | 200 | workers push probe results + ledger entries |

The public profile is bounded on every axis (rows, bytes, memory per-query and
per-user, execution time, concurrency) so the published credential can't be used for a
resource-exhaustion query. Because it's internet-facing, the deploy also sets
`select_from_system_db_requires_grant` so it can't read `system.*` (query logs /
password hashes) — see `deploy/clickhouse-deploy-prompt.md`.

> SQL-created users need a writeable access storage (`<local_directory>` under
> `user_directories`) or ClickHouse errors with "no writeable access storage".

## Pages & API

- **`/`** — server-rendered status page (crawlable; Organization + WebSite + FAQ JSON-LD).
- **`/sla`** — server-rendered Service Level Agreement (crawlable; FAQ JSON-LD).
- **`/api/overview`** — per-product, per-vantage status + 90-bar uptime, with the best vantage marked.
- **`/api/series?package=&vantage=&minutes=`** — network-RTT and proxy-connect time series.
- **`/api/scenarios?package=&vantage=`** — per-scenario stats (proxy vs `_direct`).
- **`/api/ledger`** — integrity-ledger chain heads + recent signed checkpoints + verify command.
- **`/api/status`**, **`/api/meta`** (public CH key, SLO thresholds, ledger public key + hashing spec), **`/api/events`**, **`/healthz`** (readiness — checks ClickHouse), **`/livez`** (liveness).
- **`/robots.txt`**, **`/sitemap.xml`**, **`/llms.txt`** — SEO + GEO (AI answer engines welcomed).

## Quick start

```bash
# ClickHouse + origin + website (no real proxy needed):
docker compose up --build
# open http://localhost:8080  (renders; shows "no data" until a worker runs)

# Add a worker against your own proxy to see live numbers:
ISP_PROXY_URL='http://USER:PASS@HOST:30' docker compose --profile demo up --build
```

## Configuration

JSON with `${ENV}` expansion so secrets never live in the file.

- `config/website.example.json` — listen addr, ClickHouse (reader) creds, the public
  key to publish, optional TLS, `site_url`, and SLO thresholds.
- `config/worker.example.json` — vantage id, ClickHouse (writer) creds, the
  origin(s) for payload scenarios, scrape hosts, scenario intervals, and the list of
  packages → `proxy_url` (e.g. `${ISP_PROXY_URL}`), target, and IP version.

## Deploy

- **`deploy/clickhouse-deploy-prompt.md`** — runbook to bring up a self-hosted
  ClickHouse on a bare-metal host: loopback bind + kernel-reserved ports, the three
  roles, exposed only via a Cloudflare tunnel (`ch.flashproxy.com`).
- **`deploy/terraform/`** — two-region AWS (Ashburn + Frankfurt): a dedicated
  **dual-stack VPC**, `t4g.small` instances that **build the binaries from source** in
  cloud-init, the worker + origin (+ website in Ashburn), the security group, and
  Elastic IPs. The website serves `:443` with a Cloudflare Origin Certificate so the
  zone's "Full (strict)" mode works; instances resolve DNS via Cloudflare (`1.1.1.1`).
  Secrets are supplied via env / a gitignored `*.tfvars` — never committed.

## Transparency & the SLA

This project is the measurement instrument behind FlashProxy's SLA. Because **the code
is open source** and **the metrics database is publicly readable**, every availability
figure — and every automatic SLA credit — can be independently reproduced and
challenged. See the full SLA at <https://status.flashproxy.com/sla>.
