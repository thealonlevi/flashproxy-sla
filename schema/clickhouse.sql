-- ===========================================================================
-- Each entry commits to a batch of rows (probe_raw rows for a flush, or one event)
-- via batch_hash = sha256(canonical rows), and to the previous entry via prev_hash,
-- forming a per-stream hash chain. entry_hash chains forward, so any retroactive
-- edit/delete/reorder of a covered row breaks batch_hash, and any tampering with a
-- ledger entry breaks every downstream entry_hash. seq is gap-free per stream, so a
-- deleted batch is detectable as a missing seq.
--
-- This proves tamper-EVIDENCE, not tamper-PROOFING: ClickHouse remains mutable by
-- the operator. Integrity rests on (a) this chain, (b) Ed25519-signed checkpoints
-- in sla.ledger_checkpoints, and (c) — when configured — an external anchor of the
-- signed head. The ledger is tiny, so it carries NO TTL: chain/seal integrity stays
-- verifiable indefinitely even after the underlying raw rows expire at 400 days
-- (after which the batch CONTENT can no longer be re-derived, but the chain can).
